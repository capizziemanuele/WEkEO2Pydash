    "\n",
    "### Outline\n",
    "\n",
    "This Notebook showcases Python recipes to interact (access, browse, display and download) with the Copernicus data dispatched by the [<span style='color:Blue'>WEkEO DIAS</span>](https://www.wekeo.eu), through the development of flexible and interactive dashboards into a Jupyter notebook. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Interactivity** is here used as the key element to speed-up applications development by minimizing code editing for recursive steps such as variables definition and parameters setting.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final goal is to provide the user with reusable code blocks which can be adapted *- with a small effort -* to manifold EO applications by leveraging the [<span style='color:Blue'>WEkEO Harmonised Data Access (HDA) API </span>](https://www.wekeo.eu/docs/harmonised-data-access-api) as exclusive data endpoint. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Resources\n",
    "\n",
    "This Notebook make extensive use of the [<span style='color:Blue'> WEkEO HDA API</span>](https://www.wekeo.eu/docs/harmonised-data-access-api) to perform `GET` and `POST` requests[<sup>1</sup>](#1), necessary for automating the data access procedures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interactivity is enabled by cutting-edge Python libraries for dynamic widgets and maps generation including [<span style='color:Blue'>IPython</span>](https://ipython.org), [<span style='color:Blue'>itables</span>](https://mwouts.github.io/itables/advanced_parameters.html), [<span style='color:Blue'>IPyWidgets</span>](https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html#) and [<span style='color:Blue'>ipyleaflet</span>](https://ipyleaflet.readthedocs.io); alongside popular data mananging and analysis libraries such as [<span style='color:Blue'>Pandas</span>](https://pandas.pydata.org) and [<span style='color:Blue'>xarray</span>](https://docs.xarray.dev). All the selected libraries are released under open-license[<sup>2</sup>](#2) compatible with [<span style='color:Blue'>MIT license</span>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License). \n",

It is estimated from daily global wind fields calculated from retrievals derived from ASCAT scatterometers onboard METOP-A and METOP-B satellites. It consists of six variables including monthly averaged wind speed, zonal and meridional wind components, wind stress amplitude and the associated components. They are calculated as arithmetic means of ASCAT daily wind analyses. The gridded daily wind and wind stress fields have been estimated over global oceans from Metop/ASCAT retrievals using the objective method. The daily analyses use standard products ASCAT L2b during the period April 2007 to present. Wind stress and the related components are estimated over swaths based on the use of Coare3.0 parameterization. The resulting daily fields are estimated as equivalent neutral-stability 10-m winds, and have spatial resolutions of 0.25\\u00b0 in longitude and latitude over global ocean. The objective method provides also errors characterizing the quality of each daily wind parameters at grid cell. More details about the data, the objective method, and computation algorithm may be found in (Bentamy et al, 2011. For monthly calculation purposes, only valid daily data available within each month of the period are used. The monthly winds are estimated at each grid point (0.25\\u00b0x0.25\\u00b0) from at least 25 daily values available at the same grid point. The associated root mean square (rms) values are also calculated at each grid point and used as quality control parameter.\", \"EO:MO:DAT:WIND_GLO_PHY_CLIMATE_L4_REP_012_003:CERSAT-GLO-REP_WIND_L4-OBS_FULL_TIME_SERIE\", \"https://wekeo-broker-k8s.apps.mercator.dpi.wekeo.eu/previews/EO_MO_DAT_WIND_GLO_PHY_CLIMATE_L4_REP_012_003_CERSAT-GLO-REP_WIND_L4-OBS_FULL_TIME_SERIE.png\", \"Global Ocean Daily Gridded Sea Surface Winds from Scatterometer\"], [\"'''Short description:'''\\n\\nGridded multi-mission merged satellite significant wave height.

The implementation of this product takes advantage of the consolidated operational SST processing chains that provide daily mean SST fields over the same basin (Buongiorno Nardelli et al., 2013). The sub-skin temperature is the temperature at the base of the thermal skin layer and it is equivalent to the foundation SST at night, but during daytime it can be significantly different under favorable (clear sky and low wind) diurnal warming conditions. The sub-skin SST L4 product is created by combining geostationary satellite observations aquired from SEVIRI and model data (used as first-guess) aquired from the CMEMS MED Monitoring Forecasting Center (MFC). This approach takes advantage of geostationary satellite observations as the input signal source to produce hourly gap-free SST fields using model analyses as first-guess.

The implementation of this product takes advantage of the consolidated operational SST processing chains that provide daily mean SST fields over the same basin (Buongiorno Nardelli et al., 2013). The sub-skin temperature is the temperature at the base of the thermal skin layer and it is equivalent to the foundation SST at night, but during daytime it can be significantly different under favorable (clear sky and low wind) diurnal warming conditions. The sub-skin SST L4 product is created by combining geostationary satellite observations aquired from SEVIRI and model data (used as first-guess) aquired from the CMEMS BS Monitoring Forecasting Center (MFC). This approach takes advantage of geostationary satellite observations as the input signal source to produce hourly gap-free SST fields using model analyses as first-guess. The resulting SST anomaly field (satellite-model) is free, or nearly free, of any diurnal cycle, thus allowing to interpolate SST anomalies using satellite data acquired at different times of the day (Marullo et al., 2014).\\n\\n'''DOI (product) :'''   \\nhttps://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00157\", \"EO:MO:DAT:SST_BS_PHY_SUBSKIN_L4_NRT_010_035:cmems_obs-sst_blk_phy-sst_nrt_diurnal-oi-0.0625deg_PT1H-m\", \"None\", \"Black Sea - High Resolution Diurnal Subskin Sea Surface Temperature Analysis\"], [\"'''Short description:''' \\n\\nFor the Baltic Sea- The DMI Sea Surface Temperature reprocessed analysis aims at providing daily gap-free maps of sea surface temperature, referred as L4 product, at 0.03deg. x 0.03deg. horizontal resolution, using satellite data from infra-red radiometers.

While this does not guarantee data availability in all pixels in case of persistent clouds, it provides a more complete product compared to the sparsely filled daily products. The Monthly L4 products (P1M) are generally provided withing 4 days after the last acquisition date of the month. Daily gap filled L4 products (P1D) are generated using the DINEOF (Data Interpolating Empirical Orthogonal Functions) approach which reconstructs missing data in geophysical datasets by using a truncated Empirical Orthogonal Functions (EOF) basis in an iterative approach. DINEOF reconstructs missing data in a geophysical dataset by extracting the main patterns of temporal and spatial variability from the data. While originally designed for low resolution data products, recent research has resulted in the optimization of DINEOF to handle high resolution data provided by Sentinel-2 MSI, including cloud shadow detection (Alvera-Azc\\u00e1rate et al., 2021). These types of L4 products are generated and delivered one month after the respective period.\\n\\n\\n'''Processing information:'''\\n\\nThe HR-OC processing system is deployed on Creodias where Sentinel 2/MSI L1C data are available.

This version has the qualification of the fully reprocessed time series (1997-2018) based on CCIv4 that incorporates NASA R2018.0 reprocessing for MODIS-AQUA, SeaWiFS and VIIRS, and POLYMER atmospheric correction for MERIS R2012.0.  Rrs spectra are provided by the Plymouth Marine Laboratory using an ad-hoc configuration of the ESA-CCI processor for CMEMS at high resolution, and result from the merging of SeaWiFS, MODIS-Aqua, MERIS and VIIRS sensors. Rrs is defined as the ratio of upwelling radiance and downwelling irradiance at any wavelength (412, 443, 490, 555, and 670 nm), and can also be expressed as the ratio of normalized water leaving Radiance (nLw) and the extra-terrestrial solar irradiance (F0). Kd490 is defined as the diffuse attenuation coefficient of light at 490 nm, and is a measure of the turbidity of the water column, i.e., how visible light in the blue-green region of the spectrum penetrates within the water column. It is directly related to the presence of scattering particles in the water column and is estimated through the ratio between Rrs at 490 and 555 nm.\\n\\n'''Processing information: '''\\n\\nRrs data, produced for CMEMS by Plymouth Marine Laboratory (PML) using an ad-hoc configuration of the ESA-CCI processor for CMEMS at high resolution, are converted to chlorophyll concentration via state-of-the-art algorithms for better product quality.

Kd490 is defined as the diffuse attenuation coefficient of light at 490 nm, and is a measure of the turbidity of the water column. It is related to the presence of scattering particles via the ratio between Rrs at 490 and 555 nm (490 and 560 nm for OLCI). For multi-sensor observations Kd490 is achieved via Mediterranean regional algorithm developed by GOS on the basis of MedBiOp in situ dataset (Volpe et al., 2019).

Kd490 is defined as the diffuse attenuation coefficient of light at 490 nm, and is a measure of the turbidity of the water column. It is related to the presence of scattering particles via the ratio between Rrs at 490 and 555 nm (490 and 560 nm for OLCI). For multi-sensor observations Kd490 is achieved via Mediterranean regional algorithm developed by GOS on the basis of MedBiOp in situ dataset (Volpe et al., 2019).

Exclusively for multi-sensor also the absorption of phytoplankton (aph443), Gelbstoff material (adg443), and the particulate backscattering (bbp443) coefficients at 443 nm are provided. Rrs is defined as the ratio of upwelling radiance and downwelling irradiance at any wavelength (412, 443, 490, 555, and 670 nm for multi-sensor, and 400, 412, 443, 490, 510, 560, 620, 665, 674, 681 and 709 nm for OLCI) and can also be expressed as the ratio of normalized water leaving Radiance (nLw) and the extra-terrestrial solar irradiance (F0). Kd490 is defined as the diffuse attenuation coefficient of light at 490 nm, and is a measure of the turbidity of the water column. It is related to the presence of scattering particles via the ratio between Rrs at 490 and 555 nm (490 and 560 nm for OLCI). For multi-sensor observations Kd490 is achieved via Mediterranean regional algorithm developed by GOS on the basis of MedBiOp in situ dataset (Volpe et al., 2019).

Kd490 is defined as the diffuse attenuation coefficient of light at 490 nm, and is a measure of the turbidity of the water column. It is related to the presence of scattering particles via the ratio between Rrs at 490 and 555 nm (490 and 560 nm for OLCI). For multi-sensor observations Kd490 is achieved via Mediterranean regional algorithm developed by GOS on the basis of MedBiOp in situ dataset (Volpe et al., 2019).

Exclusively for multi-sensor also the absorption of phytoplankton (aph443), Gelbstoff material (adg443), and the particulate backscattering (bbp443) coefficients at 443 nm are provided. Rrs is defined as the ratio of upwelling radiance and downwelling irradiance at any wavelength (412, 443, 490, 555, and 670 nm for multi-sensor, and 400, 412, 443, 490, 510, 560, 620, 665, 674, 681 and 709 nm for OLCI) and can also be expressed as the ratio of normalized water leaving Radiance (nLw) and the extra-terrestrial solar irradiance (F0). Kd490 is defined as the diffuse attenuation coefficient of light at 490 nm, and is a measure of the turbidity of the water column. It is related to the presence of scattering particles via the ratio between Rrs at 490 and 555 nm (490 and 560 nm for OLCI). For multi-sensor observations Kd490 is achieved via Mediterranean regional algorithm developed by GOS on the basis of MedBiOp in situ dataset (Volpe et al., 2019).

Kd490 is defined as the diffuse attenuation coefficient of light at 490 nm, and is a measure of the turbidity of the water column. It is related to the presence of scattering particles via the ratio between Rrs at 490 and 555 nm (490 and 560 nm for OLCI). For multi-sensor observations Kd490 is achieved via Mediterranean regional algorithm developed by GOS on the basis of MedBiOp in situ dataset (Volpe et al., 2019).

Time averages are computed on the delayed-time data. The interpolated product starts from the L3 products at 1 km resolution. At the first iteration, DINEOF procedure uses, as first guess for each of the missing pixels the relative daily climatological pixel. A procedure to smooth out spurious spatial gradients is applied to the daily merged image (observation and climatology). From the second iteration, the procedure uses, as input for the next one, the field obtained by the EOF calculation, using only a number of modes: that is, at the second round, only the first two modes, at the third only the first three, and so on.

Chlorophyll datasets are obtained by means of the Mediterranean Ocean Colour regional algorithms: an updated version of the MedOC4 (Case 1 water, Volpe et al., 2019) and AD4 (Case 2 water, DAlimonte and Zibordi, 2003). Discrimination between the two water types is performed by comparing the satellite spectrum at pixel-by-pixel level with the average water type spectral signature from in situ measurements for both water types.  These are computed from the MedOC4 insitu dataset (Volpe et al., 2007) for Case 1 waters and from the CoASTS insitu dataset (Berthon et al., 2002) for Case 2. Merging of Case 1 and Case 2 information is performed following DAlimonte et al. (2003).  This product identifies the average chlorophyll content of the surface layer as defined by the first optical depth (roughly one fifth of the euphotic depth). For multi-sensor observations, single sensor Rrs fields are band-shifted, over the SeaWiFS native bands (using the QAAv6 model, Lee et al., 2002) and merged with a technique aimed at smoothing the differences among different sensors.  The current day data temporal consistency is evaluated as Quality Index (QI) and available as an additional variable.  It is computed for each pixel as:\\n\\n\\nQI = (CurrentDataPixel - ClimatologyDataPixel)/STDDataPixel\\n\\n\\nwhere QI is the difference between current data and the relevant climatological field as a signed multiple of climatological standard deviations (STDDataPixel).

Daily gap filled L4 products (P1D) are generated using the DINEOF (Data Interpolating Empirical Orthogonal Functions) approach which reconstructs missing data in geophysical datasets by using a truncated Empirical Orthogonal Functions (EOF) basis in an iterative approach. DINEOF reconstructs missing data in a geophysical dataset by extracting the main patterns of temporal and spatial variability from the data. While originally designed for low resolution data products, recent research has resulted in the optimization of DINEOF to handle high resolution data provided by Sentinel-2 MSI, including cloud shadow detection (Alvera-Azc\\u00e1rate et al., 2021).

The products are delivered on a geographic lat-lon grid (EPSG:4326). To limit file size the products are provided in tiles of 600x800 km\\u00b2. BBP443, constitute the category of the 'optics' products. The  BBP443 product is generated from the L3 RRS products using a quasi-analytical algorithm (Lee et al. 2002). The 'transparency' products include TUR and SPM). They are retrieved through the application of automated switching algorithms to the RRS spectra adapted to varying water conditions (Novoa et al. 2017). The GEOPHYSICAL product consists of the Chlorophyll-a concentration (CHL) retrieved via a multi-algorithm approach with optimized quality flagging (O'Reilly et al. 2019, Gons et al. 2005, Lavigne et al. 2021). Monthly products (P1M) are temporal aggregates of the daily L3 products. Daily products contain gaps in cloudy areas and where there is no overpass at the respective day. Aggregation collects the non-cloudy (and non-frozen) contributions to each pixel. Contributions are averaged per variable. While this does not guarantee data availability in all pixels in case of persistent clouds, it provides a more complete product compared to the sparsely filled daily products. The Monthly L4 products (P1M) are generally provided withing 4 days after the last acquisition date of the month. Daily gap filled L4 products (P1D) are generated using the DINEOF (Data Interpolating Empirical Orthogonal Functions) approach which reconstructs missing data in geophysical datasets by using a truncated Empirical Orthogonal Functions (EOF) basis in an iterative approach. DINEOF reconstructs missing data in a geophysical dataset by extracting the main patterns of temporal and spatial variability from the data. While originally designed for low resolution data products, recent research has resulted in the optimization of DINEOF to handle high resolution data provided by Sentinel-2 MSI, including cloud shadow detection (Alvera-Azc\\u00e1rate et al., 2021). These types of L4 products are generated and delivered one month after the respective period.\\n\\n'''Processing information:'''\\n\\nThe HR-OC processing system is deployed on Creodias where Sentinel 2/MSI L1C data are available.

The products are delivered on a geographic lat-lon grid (EPSG:4326). To limit file size the products are provided in tiles of 600x800 km\\u00b2. BBP443, constitute the category of the 'optics' products. The  BBP443 product is generated from the L3 RRS products using a quasi-analytical algorithm (Lee et al. 2002). The 'transparency' products include TUR and SPM). They are retrieved through the application of automated switching algorithms to the RRS spectra adapted to varying water conditions (Novoa et al. 2017). The GEOPHYSICAL product consists of the Chlorophyll-a concentration (CHL) retrieved via a multi-algorithm approach with optimized quality flagging (O'Reilly et al. 2019, Gons et al. 2005, Lavigne et al. 2021). Monthly products (P1M) are temporal aggregates of the daily L3 products. Daily products contain gaps in cloudy areas and where there is no overpass at the respective day. Aggregation collects the non-cloudy (and non-frozen) contributions to each pixel. Contributions are averaged per variable. While this does not guarantee data availability in all pixels in case of persistent clouds, it provides a more complete product compared to the sparsely filled daily products. The Monthly L4 products (P1M) are generally provided withing 4 days after the last acquisition date of the month. Daily gap filled L4 products (P1D) are generated using the DINEOF (Data Interpolating Empirical Orthogonal Functions) approach which reconstructs missing data in geophysical datasets by using a truncated Empirical Orthogonal Functions (EOF) basis in an iterative approach. DINEOF reconstructs missing data in a geophysical dataset by extracting the main patterns of temporal and spatial variability from the data. While originally designed for low resolution data products, recent research has resulted in the optimization of DINEOF to handle high resolution data provided by Sentinel-2 MSI, including cloud shadow detection (Alvera-Azc\\u00e1rate et al., 2021). These types of L4 products are generated and delivered one month after the respective period.\\n\\n'''Processing information:'''\\n\\nThe HR-OC processing system is deployed on Creodias where Sentinel 2/MSI L1C data are available.

The result is a L1C mosaic tile with data just in the coastal area optimized for compression.\\n* Level 2 processing with pixel identification (IdePix), atmospheric correction (C2RCC and ACOLITE or iCOR), in-water processing and merging (HR-OC L2W processor).

All valid water pixels are included in the 20km coastal stripes; all other values are set to NaN. There may be more than a single overpass a day, in particular in the northern regions.

The 'transparency' products include TUR and SPM). They are retrieved through the application of automated switching algorithms to the RRS spectra adapted to varying water conditions (Novoa et al. 2017). The GEOPHYSICAL product consists of the Chlorophyll-a concentration (CHL) retrieved via a multi-algorithm approach with optimized quality flagging (O'Reilly et al. 2019, Gons et al. 2005, Lavigne et al. 2021). Monthly products (P1M) are temporal aggregates of the daily L3 products. Daily products contain gaps in cloudy areas and where there is no overpass at the respective day. Aggregation collects the non-cloudy (and non-frozen) contributions to each pixel. Contributions are averaged per variable. While this does not guarantee data availability in all pixels in case of persistent clouds, it provides a more complete product compared to the sparsely filled daily products. The Monthly L4 products (P1M) are generally provided withing 4 days after the last acquisition date of the month. Daily gap filled L4 products (P1D) are generated using the DINEOF (Data Interpolating Empirical Orthogonal Functions) approach which reconstructs missing data in geophysical datasets by using a truncated Empirical Orthogonal Functions (EOF) basis in an iterative approach. DINEOF reconstructs missing data in a geophysical dataset by extracting the main patterns of temporal and spatial variability from the data. While originally designed for low resolution data products, recent research has resulted in the optimization of DINEOF to handle high resolution data provided by Sentinel-2 MSI, including cloud shadow detection (Alvera-Azc\\u00e1rate et al., 2021). These types of L4 products are generated and delivered one month after the respective period.\\n\\n'''Processing information:'''\\n\\nThe HR-OC processing system is deployed on Creodias where Sentinel 2/MSI L1C data are available.

After removing the atmospheric contribution, the water leaving radiance recorded at a given time by the satellite reflects the optical properties of the water which, in turn, mirrors a specific structure and biogeochemical composition of the marine waters.\\n\\n'''Quality / Accuracy / Calibration information:'''\\n\\nThe user is referred to the  QUID documentation\\n\\n'''Suitability, Expected type of users / uses:'''\\n\\n This product is meant for use for educational purposes and for the managing of the marine safety, marine resources, marine and coastal environment and for climate and seasonal studies.\", \"EO:MO:DAT:OCEANCOLOUR_GLO_OPTICS_L3_REP_OBSERVATIONS_009_064:dataset-oc-glo-opt-multi_cci-l3-rrs412_4km_daily-rep-v02\", \"https://wekeo-broker-k8s.apps.mercator.dpi.wekeo.eu/previews/EO_MO_DAT_OCEANCOLOUR_GLO_OPTICS_L3_REP_OBSERVATIONS_009_064_dataset-oc-glo-opt-multi_cci-l3-rrs412_4km_daily-rep-v02.png\", \"Global Ocean, Ocean Optics Products (daily average) Reprocessed L3 (ESA-CCI)\"], [\"'''Short description: '''\\n\\nFor the '''Global''' Ocean ''Satellite Observations''', ACRI-ST company (Sophia Antipolis, France) is providing '''Chlorophyll-a''' and '''Optics''' products [1997 - present] based on the '''Copernicus-GlobColour''' processor.\\n* '''Chlorophyll and Bio''' products refer to Chlorophyll-a, Primary Production (PP) and Phytoplankton Functional types (PFT).

Exclusively for multi-sensor also the absorption of phytoplankton (aph443), Gelbstoff material (adg443), and the particulate backscattering (bbp443) coefficients at 443 nm are provided. Rrs is defined as the ratio of upwelling radiance and downwelling irradiance at any wavelength (412, 443, 490, 555, and 670 nm for multi-sensor, and 400, 412, 443, 490, 510, 560, 620, 665, 674, 681 and 709 nm for OLCI) and can also be expressed as the ratio of normalized water leaving Radiance (nLw) and the extra-terrestrial solar irradiance (F0).  Kd490 is defined as the diffuse attenuation coefficient of light at 490 nm, and is a measure of the turbidity of the water column. It is related to the presence of scattering particles via the ratio between Rrs at 490 and 555 nm (490 and 560 nm for OLCI).  The current day data temporal consistency is evaluated as Quality Index (QI) and is available as an additional variable. It is computed for each pixel as:\\n\\n\\nQI = (CurrentDataPixel - ClimatologyDataPixel)/STDDataPixel\\n\\n\\nwhere QI is the difference between current data and the relevant climatological field as a signed multiple of climatological standard deviations (STDDataPixel).

For consistency with the MODIS and VIIRS NASA L2 dataset BRDF correction was applied to OLCI prior to band shifting and multi sensor merging. Hence, the single sensor OLCI data set is also distributed after BRDF correction.  Single sensor Level-2 data are destriped and remapped at 1 km spatial resolution using cylindrical equirectangular projection. Afterwards, single sensor Rrs fields are band-shifted, over the SeaWiFS native bands (using the QAAv6 model, Lee et al., 2002) and merged with a technique aimed at smoothing the differences among different sensors.

Exclusively for multi-sensor also the absorption of phytoplankton (aph443), Gelbstoff material (adg443), and the particulate backscattering (bbp443) coefficients at 443 nm are provided. Rrs is defined as the ratio of upwelling radiance and downwelling irradiance at any wavelength (412, 443, 490, 555, and 670 nm for multi-sensor, and 400, 412, 443, 490, 510, 560, 620, 665, 674, 681 and 709 nm for OLCI) and can also be expressed as the ratio of normalized water leaving Radiance (nLw) and the extra-terrestrial solar irradiance (F0).  Kd490 is defined as the diffuse attenuation coefficient of light at 490 nm, and is a measure of the turbidity of the water column. It is related to the presence of scattering particles via the ratio between Rrs at 490 and 555 nm (490 and 560 nm for OLCI).  The current day data temporal consistency is evaluated as Quality Index (QI) and is available as an additional variable. It is computed for each pixel as:\\n\\n\\nQI = (CurrentDataPixel - ClimatologyDataPixel)/STDDataPixel\\n\\n\\nwhere QI is the difference between current data and the relevant climatological field as a signed multiple of climatological standard deviations (STDDataPixel).

Afterwards, single sensor Rrs fields are band-shifted, over the SeaWiFS native bands (using the QAAv6 model, Lee et al., 2002) and merged with a technique aimed at smoothing the differences among different sensors. This technique is developed by The Global Ocean Satellite monitoring and marine ecosystem study group (GOS) of the Italian National Research Council (CNR, Rome).

Level-4 includes both monthly time averages and the daily-interpolated fields. Time averages are computed on the delayed-time data. The interpolated product starts from the L3 products at 1 km resolution. At the first iteration, DINEOF procedure uses, as first guess for each of the missing pixels the relative daily climatological pixel. A procedure to smooth out spurious spatial gradients is applied to the daily merged image (observation and climatology). From the second iteration, the procedure uses, as input for the next one, the field obtained by the EOF calculation, using only a number of modes: that is, at the second round, only the first two modes, at the third only the first three, and so on.

The chlorophyll (Chl) product is obtained combine two different regional algorithms. The first is a band-ratio algorithm (Zibordi et al., 2015) that computes Chl as a function of the slope of Rrs values at two wavelengths (490 and 555 nm). The second one is a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) neural net based on Rrs values at three individual wavelengths (490, 510 and 555 nm) that features interpolation capabilities helpful to fit data non-linearities. The merging scheme (Kajiyama et al., 2018) has been designed to use the B/R algorithm and the MLP neural net in waters exhibiting lower and higher optical complexity, respectively. The interpolated gap-free Level-4 Chlorophyll concentration is estimated by means of a modified version of the DINEOF algorithm by GOS (Volpe et al., 2018). DINEOF is an iterative procedure in which EOF are used to reconstruct the entire field domain. As first guess, it uses the SeaWiFS-derived daily climatological values at missing pixels and satellite observations at valid pixels. The other L4 datasets (monthly) are the time averages of the L3 fields (including standard deviation and the number of observations). These products quantify the average chlorophyll content of the surface layer as defined by the first optical depth.\\n\\n'''Processing information:'''\\n\\nNRT  multi-sensor products (MODIS+VIIRS+OLCI) incorporate OLCI in the processing chain.

The products are delivered on a geographic lat-lon grid (EPSG:4326). To limit file size the products are provided in tiles of 600x800 km\\u00b2. BBP443, constitute the category of the 'optics' products. The  BBP443 product is generated from the L3 RRS products using a quasi-analytical algorithm (Lee et al. 2002). The 'transparency' products include TUR and SPM). They are retrieved through the application of automated switching algorithms to the RRS spectra adapted to varying water conditions (Novoa et al. 2017). The GEOPHYSICAL product consists of the Chlorophyll-a concentration (CHL) retrieved via a multi-algorithm approach with optimized quality flagging (O'Reilly et al. 2019, Gons et al. 2005, Lavigne et al. 2021). Monthly products (P1M) are temporal aggregates of the daily L3 products. Daily products contain gaps in cloudy areas and where there is no overpass at the respective day. Aggregation collects the non-cloudy (and non-frozen) contributions to each pixel. Contributions are averaged per variable. While this does not guarantee data availability in all pixels in case of persistent clouds, it provides a more complete product compared to the sparsely filled daily products. The Monthly L4 products (P1M) are generally provided withing 4 days after the last acquisition date of the month. Daily gap filled L4 products (P1D) are generated using the DINEOF (Data Interpolating Empirical Orthogonal Functions) approach which reconstructs missing data in geophysical datasets by using a truncated Empirical Orthogonal Functions (EOF) basis in an iterative approach. DINEOF reconstructs missing data in a geophysical dataset by extracting the main patterns of temporal and spatial variability from the data. While originally designed for low resolution data products, recent research has resulted in the optimization of DINEOF to handle high resolution data provided by Sentinel-2 MSI, including cloud shadow detection (Alvera-Azc\\u00e1rate et al., 2021). These types of L4 products are generated and delivered one month after the respective period.\\n\\n\\n'''Processing information:'''\\n\\nThe HR-OC processing system is deployed on Creodias where Sentinel 2/MSI L1C data are available. The production control element is being hosted within the infrastructure of Brockmann Consult. The processing chain consists of:\\n* Resampling to 60m and mosaic generation of the set of Sentinel-2 MSI L1C granules of a single overpass that cover a single UTM zone.\\n* Application of a coastal mask with 20km water + 20km land. The result is a L1C mosaic tile with data just in the coastal area optimized for compression.\\n* Level 2 processing with pixel identification (IdePix), atmospheric correction (C2RCC and ACOLITE or iCOR), in-water processing and merging (HR-OC L2W processor). The result is a 60m product with the same extent as the L1C mosaic, with variables for optics, transparency, and geophysics, and with data filled in the water part of the coastal area.\\n* Daily L3 aggregation merges all Level 2 mosaics of a day intersecting with a target tile. All valid water pixels are included in the 20km coastal stripes; all other values are set to NaN. There may be more than a single overpass a day, in particular in the northern regions. The main contribution usually is the mosaic of the zone, but also adjacent mosaics may overlap. This step comprises resampling to the 100m target grid. \\n* Monthly L4 aggregation combines all Level 3 products of a month and a single tile. The output is a set of 3 NetCDF datasets for optics, transparency, and geophysics respectively, for the tile and month.\\n* Gap filling combines all daily products of a period and generates (partially) gap-filled daily products again. The output of gap filling are 3 datasets for optics (BBP443 only), transparency, and geophysics per day.\\n\\n\\n'''Description of observation methods/instruments:'''\\n\\nOcean colour technique exploits the emerging electromagnetic radiation from the sea surface in different wavelengths.

The 'transparency' products include TUR and SPM). They are retrieved through the application of automated switching algorithms to the RRS spectra adapted to varying water conditions (Novoa et al. 2017). The GEOPHYSICAL product consists of the Chlorophyll-a concentration (CHL) retrieved via a multi-algorithm approach with optimized quality flagging (O'Reilly et al. 2019, Gons et al. 2005, Lavigne et al. 2021). Monthly products (P1M) are temporal aggregates of the daily L3 products. Daily products contain gaps in cloudy areas and where there is no overpass at the respective day. Aggregation collects the non-cloudy (and non-frozen) contributions to each pixel. Contributions are averaged per variable. While this does not guarantee data availability in all pixels in case of persistent clouds, it provides a more complete product compared to the sparsely filled daily products. The Monthly L4 products (P1M) are generally provided withing 4 days after the last acquisition date of the month. Daily gap filled L4 products (P1D) are generated using the DINEOF (Data Interpolating Empirical Orthogonal Functions) approach which reconstructs missing data in geophysical datasets by using a truncated Empirical Orthogonal Functions (EOF) basis in an iterative approach. DINEOF reconstructs missing data in a geophysical dataset by extracting the main patterns of temporal and spatial variability from the data. While originally designed for low resolution data products, recent research has resulted in the optimization of DINEOF to handle high resolution data provided by Sentinel-2 MSI, including cloud shadow detection (Alvera-Azc\\u00e1rate et al., 2021). These types of L4 products are generated and delivered one month after the respective period.\\n\\n\\n'''Processing information:'''\\n\\nThe HR-OC processing system is deployed on Creodias where Sentinel 2/MSI L1C data are available.

Rrs spectra are provided by the Plymouth Marine Laboratory using an ad-hoc configuration of the ESA-CCI processor for CMEMS at high resolution, and result from the merging of SeaWiFS, MODIS-Aqua, MERIS and VIIRS sensors. Rrs is defined as the ratio of upwelling radiance and downwelling irradiance at any wavelength (412, 443, 490, 555, and 670 nm), and can also be expressed as the ratio of normalized water leaving Radiance (nLw) and the extra-terrestrial solar irradiance (F0).  Kd490 is defined as the diffuse attenuation coefficient of light at 490 nm, and is a measure of the turbidity of the water column, i.e., how visible light in the blue-green region of the spectrum penetrates within the water column.  It is directly related to the presence of scattering particles in the water column and is estimated through the ratio between Rrs at 490 and 555 nm.\\n\\n'''Processing information:'''\\n\\nRrs data, provided for Copernicus by Plymouth Marine Laboratory (PML) using the ESA-CCI processor, derive from a merging exercise of different sensors acquisition: SeaWiFS, MERIS, MODIS-Aqua and VIIRS.

Monthly products (P1M) are temporal aggregates of the daily L3 products. Daily products contain gaps in cloudy areas and where there is no overpass at the respective day. Aggregation collects the non-cloudy (and non-frozen) contributions to each pixel. Contributions are averaged per variable. While this does not guarantee data availability in all pixels in case of persistent clouds, it provides a more complete product compared to the sparsely filled daily products. The Monthly L4 products (P1M) are generally provided withing 4 days after the last acquisition date of the month. Daily gap filled L4 products (P1D) are generated using the DINEOF (Data Interpolating Empirical Orthogonal Functions) approach which reconstructs missing data in geophysical datasets by using a truncated Empirical Orthogonal Functions (EOF) basis in an iterative approach. DINEOF reconstructs missing data in a geophysical dataset by extracting the main patterns of temporal and spatial variability from the data. While originally designed for low resolution data products, recent research has resulted in the optimization of DINEOF to handle high resolution data provided by Sentinel-2 MSI, including cloud shadow detection (Alvera-Azc\\u00e1rate et al., 2021).

Aggregation collects the non-cloudy (and non-frozen) contributions to each pixel. Contributions are averaged per variable.

The Monthly L4 products (P1M) are generally provided withing 4 days after the last acquisition date of the month. Daily gap filled L4 products (P1D) are generated using the DINEOF (Data Interpolating Empirical Orthogonal Functions) approach which reconstructs missing data in geophysical datasets by using a truncated Empirical Orthogonal Functions (EOF) basis in an iterative approach. DINEOF reconstructs missing data in a geophysical dataset by extracting the main patterns of temporal and spatial variability from the data. While originally designed for low resolution data products, recent research has resulted in the optimization of DINEOF to handle high resolution data provided by Sentinel-2 MSI, including cloud shadow detection (Alvera-Azc\\u00e1rate et al., 2021).

These are derived from level 2 data produced by SeaDAS l2gen (MODIS, VIIRS and SeaWiFS) and Polymer (MERIS) , and the resulting Rrs bias corrected.\\n\\n'''Processing information:'''\\n\\nESA-CCI Rrs raw data are provided by Plymouth Marine Laboratory, currently at 4km resolution.  These are processed to produce CMEMS representations using the same in-house software as in the operational processing. The entire CCI data set is consistent and processing is done in one go.  Both OC CCI and the REP product are versioned. Standard masking criteria for detecting clouds or other contamination factors have been applied during the generation of the Rrs, i.e., land, cloud, sun glint, atmospheric correction failure, high total radiance, large solar zenith angle (70deg), large spacecraft zenith angle (56deg), coccolithophores, negative water leaving radiance, and normalized water leaving radiance at 555 nm 0.15 Wm-2 sr-1 (McClain et al., 1995). For the regional products, a variant of the OC-CCI chain is run to produce high resolution data at the 1km resolution necessary.\", \"EO:MO:DAT:OCEANCOLOUR_ATL_OPTICS_L3_REP_OBSERVATIONS_009_066:dataset-oc-atl-opt-multi_cci-l3-adg443_1km_daily-rep\", \"https://wekeo-broker-k8s.apps.mercator.dpi.wekeo.eu/previews/EO_MO_DAT_OCEANCOLOUR_ATL_OPTICS_L3_REP_OBSERVATIONS_009_066_dataset-oc-atl-opt-multi_cci-l3-adg443_1km_daily-rep.png\", \"North Atlantic Ocean, Ocean Optics Products (daily average) Reprocessed L3 (ESA-CCI)\"], [\"'''Short description:'''\\n\\nProducts ADG (volume absorption coefficient of radiative flux in sea water due to dissolved organic matter and non algal particles), APH (volume absorption coefficient of radiative flux in sea water due to phytoplankton) and ATOT (volume absorption coefficient of radiative flux in sea water) are described in the PML Inherent Optical Property model (Smyth, T.J., Moore, G.F., Hirata, T.

Phytoplankton functional types (PFT) dataset provides daily chlorophyll concentrations of 5 phytoplankton groups: nano-, pico-, micro-phytoplankton, diatoms and dinoflagellates. Micro consists of the sum of diatoms and dinoflagellates. L3 products are daily files, while the L4 are monthly composites.  ESA-CCI Rrs raw data are provided by PML.

The products of region ARC are delivered in polar Lambertian Azimuthal Equal Area (LAEA) projection (EPSG:6931, EASE2). To limit file size the products are provided in tiles of 600x800 km\\u00b2. BBP443, constitute the category of the 'optics' products. The  BBP443 product is generated from the L3 RRS products using a quasi-analytical algorithm (Lee et al. 2002). The 'transparency' products include TUR and SPM). They are retrieved through the application of automated switching algorithms to the RRS spectra adapted to varying water conditions (Novoa et al. 2017). The GEOPHYSICAL product consists of the Chlorophyll-a concentration (CHL) retrieved via a multi-algorithm approach with optimized quality flagging (O'Reilly et al. 2019, Gons et al. 2005, Lavigne et al. 2021). Monthly products (P1M) are temporal aggregates of the daily L3 products. Daily products contain gaps in cloudy areas and where there is no overpass at the respective day. Aggregation collects the non-cloudy (and non-frozen) contributions to each pixel. Contributions are averaged per variable. While this does not guarantee data availability in all pixels in case of persistent clouds, it provides a more complete product compared to the sparsely filled daily products. The Monthly L4 products (P1M) are generally provided withing 4 days after the last acquisition date of the month. Daily gap filled L4 products (P1D) are generated using the DINEOF (Data Interpolating Empirical Orthogonal Functions) approach which reconstructs missing data in geophysical datasets by using a truncated Empirical Orthogonal Functions (EOF) basis in an iterative approach. DINEOF reconstructs missing data in a geophysical dataset by extracting the main patterns of temporal and spatial variability from the data. While originally designed for low resolution data products, recent research has resulted in the optimization of DINEOF to handle high resolution data provided by Sentinel-2 MSI, including cloud shadow detection (Alvera-Azc\\u00e1rate et al., 2021). These types of L4 products are generated and delivered one month after the respective period.\\n\\n\\n'''Processing information:'''\\n\\nThe HR-OC processing system is deployed on Creodias where Sentinel 2/MSI L1C data are available. The production control element is being hosted within the infrastructure of Brockmann Consult. The processing chain consists of:\\n* Resampling to 60m and mosaic generation of the set of Sentinel-2 MSI L1C granules of a single overpass that cover a single UTM zone.\\n* Application of a coastal mask with 20km water + 20km land. The result is a L1C mosaic tile with data just in the coastal area optimized for compression.\\n* Level 2 processing with pixel identification (IdePix), atmospheric correction (C2RCC and ACOLITE or iCOR), in-water processing and merging (HR-OC L2W processor). The result is a 60m product with the same extent as the L1C mosaic, with variables for optics, transparency, and geophysics, and with data filled in the water part of the coastal area.\\n* Daily L3 aggregation merges all Level 2 mosaics of a day intersecting with a target tile. All valid water pixels are included in the 20km coastal stripes; all other values are set to NaN. There may be more than a single overpass a day, in particular in the northern regions. The main contribution usually is the mosaic of the zone, but also adjacent mosaics may overlap. This step comprises resampling to the 100m target grid. \\n* Monthly L4 aggregation combines all Level 3 products of a month and a single tile.

The products of region ARC are delivered in polar Lambertian Azimuthal Equal Area (LAEA) projection (EPSG:6931, EASE2). To limit file size the products are provided in tiles of 600x800 km\\u00b2. BBP443, constitute the category of the 'optics' products. The  BBP443 product is generated from the L3 RRS products using a quasi-analytical algorithm (Lee et al. 2002). The 'transparency' products include TUR and SPM). They are retrieved through the application of automated switching algorithms to the RRS spectra adapted to varying water conditions (Novoa et al. 2017). The GEOPHYSICAL product consists of the Chlorophyll-a concentration (CHL) retrieved via a multi-algorithm approach with optimized quality flagging (O'Reilly et al. 2019, Gons et al. 2005, Lavigne et al. 2021). Monthly products (P1M) are temporal aggregates of the daily L3 products. Daily products contain gaps in cloudy areas and where there is no overpass at the respective day. Aggregation collects the non-cloudy (and non-frozen) contributions to each pixel. Contributions are averaged per variable. While this does not guarantee data availability in all pixels in case of persistent clouds, it provides a more complete product compared to the sparsely filled daily products. The Monthly L4 products (P1M) are generally provided withing 4 days after the last acquisition date of the month. Daily gap filled L4 products (P1D) are generated using the DINEOF (Data Interpolating Empirical Orthogonal Functions) approach which reconstructs missing data in geophysical datasets by using a truncated Empirical Orthogonal Functions (EOF) basis in an iterative approach. DINEOF reconstructs missing data in a geophysical dataset by extracting the main patterns of temporal and spatial variability from the data. While originally designed for low resolution data products, recent research has resulted in the optimization of DINEOF to handle high resolution data provided by Sentinel-2 MSI, including cloud shadow detection (Alvera-Azc\\u00e1rate et al., 2021). These types of L4 products are generated and delivered one month after the respective period.\\n\\n\\n'''Processing information:'''\\n\\nThe HR-OC processing system is deployed on Creodias where Sentinel 2/MSI L1C data are available.

While originally designed for low resolution data products, recent research has resulted in the optimization of DINEOF to handle high resolution data provided by Sentinel-2 MSI, including cloud shadow detection (Alvera-Azc\\u00e1rate et al., 2021). These types of L4 products are generated and delivered one month after the respective period.\\n\\n\\n'''Processing information:'''\\n\\nThe HR-OC processing system is deployed on Creodias where Sentinel 2/MSI L1C data are available. The production control element is being hosted within the infrastructure of Brockmann Consult. The processing chain consists of:\\n* Resampling to 60m and mosaic generation of the set of Sentinel-2 MSI L1C granules of a single overpass that cover a single UTM zone.\\n* Application of a coastal mask with 20km water + 20km land. The result is a L1C mosaic tile with data just in the coastal area optimized for compression.\\n* Level 2 processing with pixel identification (IdePix), atmospheric correction (C2RCC and ACOLITE or iCOR), in-water processing and merging (HR-OC L2W processor). The result is a 60m product with the same extent as the L1C mosaic, with variables for optics, transparency, and geophysics, and with data filled in the water part of the coastal area.\\n* Daily L3 aggregation merges all Level 2 mosaics of a day intersecting with a target tile. All valid water pixels are included in the 20km coastal stripes; all other values are set to NaN. There may be more than a single overpass a day, in particular in the northern regions. The main contribution usually is the mosaic of the zone, but also adjacent mosaics may overlap. This step comprises resampling to the 100m target grid. \\n* Monthly L4 aggregation combines all Level 3 products of a month and a single tile. The output is a set of 3 NetCDF datasets for optics, transparency, and geophysics respectively, for the tile and month.\\n* Gap filling combines all daily products of a period and generates (partially) gap-filled daily products again. The output of gap filling are 3 datasets for optics (BBP443 only), transparency, and geophysics per day.\\n\\n\\n'''Description of observation methods/instruments:'''\\n\\nOcean colour technique exploits the emerging electromagnetic radiation from the sea surface in different wavelengths.

It contains a Reanalysis dataset and an Interim dataset which covers the period after the reanalysis until 1 month before present. The Reanalysis dataset is a multi-year wave reanalysis starting from January 1993, composed by hourly wave parameters at 1/24\\u00b0 horizontal resolution, covering the Mediterranean Sea and extending up to 18.125W into the Atlantic Ocean. The Med-waves modelling system is based on wave model WAM 4.6.2 and has been developed as a nested sequence of two computational grids (coarse and fine) to ensure that swell propagating from the North Atlantic (NA) towards the strait of Gibraltar is correctly entering the Mediterranean Sea. The coarse grid covers the North Atlantic Ocean from 75\\u00b0W to 10\\u00b0E and from 70\\u00b0 N to 10\\u00b0 S in 1/6\\u00b0 resolution while the nested fine grid covers the Mediterranean Sea from 18.125\\u00b0 W to 36.2917\\u00b0 E and from 30.1875\\u00b0 N to 45.9792\\u00b0 N with a 1/24\\u00b0 resolution. The modelling system resolves the prognostic part of the wave spectrum with 24 directional and 32 logarithmically distributed frequency bins.  The wave system also includes an optimal interpolation assimilation scheme assimilating significant wave height along track satellite observations available through CMEMS and it is forced with daily averaged currents from Med-Physics and with 1-h, 0.25\\u00b0 horizontal-resolution ERA5 reanalysis 10m-above-sea-surface winds from ECMWF.  \\n\\n'''DOI (product) :'''\\nhttps://doi.org/10.25423/cmcc/medsea_multiyear_wav_006_012\\n\\n'''Product Citation :'''\\nPlease refer to our Technical FAQ for citing products.http://marine.copernicus.eu/faq/cite-cmems-products-cmems-credit/?idpage=169\", \"EO:MO:DAT:MEDSEA_MULTIYEAR_WAV_006_012:med-hcmr-wav-rean-h\", \"https://wekeo-broker-k8s.apps.mercator.dpi.wekeo.eu/previews/EO_MO_DAT_MEDSEA_MULTIYEAR_WAV_006_012_med-hcmr-wav-rean-h.png\", \"Mediterranean Sea Waves Reanalysis\"], [\"'''Short description:'''\\nThe Med MFC physical reanalysis product is generated by a numerical system composed of an hydrodynamic model, supplied by the Nucleous for European Modelling of the Ocean (NEMO) and a variational data assimilation scheme (OceanVAR) for temperature and salinity vertical profiles and satellite Sea Level Anomaly along track data.

The waves forecast component (Med-Waves system) is a wave model based on the upgraded WAM Cycle 4.6.2. The Med-Waves modelling system resolves the prognostic part of the wave spectrum with 24 directional and 32 logarithmically distributed frequency bins and the model solutions are corrected by an optimal interpolation data assimilation scheme of all available along track satellite significant wave height observations.

This product includes 3-hourly instantaneous fields of integrated wave parameters from the total spectrum (significant height, period, direction, Stokes drift,...etc), as well as the following partitions: the wind wave, the primary and secondary swell waves.\\n\\nThe global wave system of M\\u00e9t\\u00e9o-France is based on the wave model MFWAM which is a third generation wave model. MFWAM uses the computing code ECWAM-IFS-38R2 with a dissipation terms developed by Ardhuin et al. (2010). The model MFWAM was upgraded on november 2014 thanks to improvements obtained from the european research project \\u00ab my wave \\u00bb (Janssen et al. 2014). The model mean bathymetry is generated by using 2-minute gridded global topography data ETOPO2/NOAA. Native model grid is irregular with decreasing distance in the latitudinal direction close to the poles. At the equator the distance in the latitudinal direction is more or less fixed with grid size 1/10\\u00b0. The operational model MFWAM is driven by 6-hourly analysis and 3-hourly forecasted winds from the IFS-ECMWF atmospheric system. The wave spectrum is discretized in 24 directions and 30 frequencies starting from 0.035 Hz to 0.58 Hz. The model MFWAM uses the assimilation of altimeters with a time step of 6 hours.

A trader or a fleet manager can use this information to estimate the average time and fuel consumption of a journey for a given month together with the uncertainty on meeting the target time of arrival.

The 5 most skillful CMIP5 models were used (relative root mean square error < 10%) to derive the present indicators. Both RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 CMIP5 experiments were considered.\\nTwo different types of indicators were produced. The first type provides information about the ice and accessibility conditions over the whole arctic ocean and includes: Sea ice extent maps, accessibility maps for different ice classes and average sea ice concentration and thickness conditions maps.\\nThe second type of indicators (e.g. trip duration,  fuel consumption) provides information about the navigation conditions along a specific arctic route going through the so-called North-East Passage  for an ARC4 bulk carrier. \\nDue to the global warming and the continuous decline of Arctic sea ice, maritime transport in the Arctic region has been increased dramatically. While operating in the Arctic area, ships face regular environment loads and ice loads synchronously, the consideration of ice resistance is essential for the\\nfuel consumption estimation in the ice-covered water voyage. For this specific bulk carrier, the Arctic\\nsailing cost is composed of the following operational costs: the insurance cost is assumed to be 500usd/day, the ship renting cost is assumed to be 40kusd/day and the crew cost (including wages, social benefits, entertainments, etc.) is assumed to be 6kusd/day.\\nThe other big category of the cost is associated with the fuel cost. The fuel cost is computed by first\\nestimating the ship\\u2019s resistance in the still water and in various ice conditions along the arctic ship route. It should be noted that since in the climate projection data does not contain the wave and wind\\ninformation, the resistance caused by wind and wave will be neglected in the calculation. The calm/still water resistance is estimated by the well-known formula proposed by Holtrop and Mennen (1982). The ice resistance is estimated by the method proposed by Lindqvist (1989), which divides resistance components into ice crushing, bending-induced breaking and submergence, based on the physical phenomena. This method gives ice resistance as functions of ship main dimensions, hull form, ice thickness, ice friction and ice strength.\\nAfter getting the ship resistance for various ice conditions and operational conditions (ship speed), it will be divided by the propulsion efficiency of the ship to get the require marine engine power, that can push the ship forward to overtake the still water and ice resistance. The fuel consumption rate for the calculated engine power will be easily analysed by given the engine oil properties. For the given arctic ship route and sailing time (speeds), the total fuel cost can be estimated. The ship\\u2019s (maximum) sailing speed at various ice conditions is determined according to the Russian Polar Class rules.\\nFinally, another cost is related to if the ship needs support from Ice breaker for resorted ice navigation. Whether or not the ice breaker is needed is determined according to the ship\\u2019s ice class and the most severe ice conditions along the ship\\u2019s arctic route during that voyage based on Russian Polar Class rules.

To achieve this, a steady two-satellite merged constellation is used at all time steps in the production system: one satellite serves as reference and ensures the long-term stability of the data record; the other satellite (which varies across the record) is used to improve accuracy, sample mesoscale processes and provide coverage at high latitudes.

Reanalysis produces data that goes several decades back in time, providing an accurate description of the climate of the past. \\nERA5-Land uses as input to control the simulated land fields ERA5 atmospheric variables, such as air temperature and air humidity. This is called the atmospheric forcing. Without the constraint of the atmospheric forcing, the model-based estimates can rapidly deviate from reality. Therefore, while observations are not directly used in the production of ERA5-Land, they have an indirect influence through the atmospheric forcing used to run the simulation. In addition, the input air temperature, air humidity and pressure used to run ERA5-Land are corrected to account for the altitude difference between the grid of the forcing and the higher resolution grid of ERA5-Land. This correction is called 'lapse rate correction'.    \\nThe ERA5-Land dataset, as any other simulation, provides estimates which have some degree of uncertainty. Numerical models can only provide a more or less accurate representation of the real physical processes governing different components of the Earth System. In general, the uncertainty of model estimates grows as we go back in time, because the number of observations available to create a good quality atmospheric forcing is lower.

These instruments measure spectrally resolved near-infrared and infrared radiation reflected or emitted by the Earth and its atmosphere.

Reanalysis works in the same way, but at reduced resolution to allow for the provision of a dataset spanning back several decades.

By correctly modelling the winds, vertical diffusion, and convection in the global atmosphere, the observed concentrations of the greenhouse gases are used to infer the surface fluxes for the last few decades. For CH4 and N2O, the flux inversions account also for the chemical loss of these greenhouse gases. The net fluxes include contributions from the natural biosphere (e.g., vegetation, wetlands) as well anthropogenic contributions (e.g., fossil fuel emissions, rice fields). The data sets for the three species are updated once or twice per year adding the most recent year to the data record, while re-processing the original data record for consistency. This is reflected by the different version numbers. In addition, fluxes for methane are available based on surface air samples only or based on a combination of surface air samples and satellite observations (reflected by an 's' in the version number).

Reanalysis combines model data with observations from across the world into a globally complete and consistent dataset using a model of the atmosphere based on the laws of physics and chemistry. This principle, called data assimilation, is based on the method used by numerical weather prediction centres and air quality forecasting centres, where every so many hours (12 hours at ECMWF) a previous forecast is combined with newly available observations in an optimal way to produce a new best estimate of the state of the atmosphere, called analysis, from which an updated, improved forecast is issued. Reanalysis works in the same way to allow for the provision of a dataset spanning back more than a decade. Reanalysis does not have the constraint of issuing timely forecasts, so there is more time to collect observations, and when going further back in time, to allow for the ingestion of improved versions of the original observations, which all benefit the quality of the reanalysis product.\\n\\nThe assimilation system is able to estimate biases between observations and to sift good-quality data from poor data. The atmosphere model allows for estimates at locations where data coverage is low or for atmospheric pollutants for which no direct observations are available. The provision of estimates at each grid point around the globe for each regular output time, over a long period, always using the same format, makes reanalysis a very convenient and popular dataset to work with.\\n\\nThe observing system has changed drastically over time, and although the assimilation system can resolve data holes, the initially much sparser networks will lead to less accurate estimates.
